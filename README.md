font-awesome-ie7
================

Add-on to the font-awesome style. This style is written for font-awesome version 4.0.3.
The previously font-awesome-ie7 was written for version 3.2.1. See http://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome/
for the history.

Icon names are identical to the font-awesome so that no changes in the original syntax is needed. 
Just link this css and youÂ´re good to go. Tested in IE8 Compatibility mode and IE7

For all those who are forced to use crappy IE-versions.

Happy coding!
